From a Powershell command line: 

.\audit2cm.ps1 -TextFilePath ".\hostnames.txt" -CollectionName "Existing Device Collection" -SiteCode "ABC"



DESCRIPTION
This script streamlines the process of populating a Configuration Manager device collection with devices listed in an external text file. Each line in the text file should contain a single computer hostname.

PARAMETER TextFilePath
The full path to the text file containing the list of computer hostnames.
Each hostname should be on a new line.

PARAMETER CollectionName
The name of the Configuration Manager device collection to which devices will be added. This collection must already exist.

PARAMETER SiteCode
Your Configuration Manager site code (e.g., "P01", "MEM").

NOTES

- Ensure the target Device Collection ***already exists*** within Configuration Manager

- Ensure your Powershell settings allow for executing unsigned scripts, or have your company sign this script if required
- Copy the hostnames from your report (Excel, PDF, etc) into a notepad file, with 1 hostname per line
- Ensure the Configuration Manager console is installed on the machine where this script is executed, as it provides the necessary PowerShell module.
- The user running the script must have sufficient permissions in ConfigMgr to add devices to the specified collection.
- The script will attempt to find the device in ConfigMgr. If a hostname is not found, it will be skipped and logged.
